# Acting as Inverse Inverse Planning

This repository contains source code to accompany the SIGGRAPH paper [Acting as
Inverse Inverse Planning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3588432.3591510) (Chandra,

> Great storytellers know how to take us on a journey. They direct characters
> to act---not necessarily in the most rational way---but rather in a way that
> leads to interesting situations, and ultimately creates an impactful
> experience for the audience members looking on.
> 
> If audience experience is what matters, can we help artists and animators
> _directly_ craft such experiences, independent of the concrete character
> actions needed to evoke those experiences? In this paper, we offer a novel
> computational framework for such tools. Our key idea is to optimize
> animations with respect to _simulated_ audience members' experiences.
> 
> To simulate the audience, we borrow an established principle from cognitive
> science: that human social intuition can be modeled as "inverse planning,"
> the task of inferring an agent's (hidden) goals from its (observed) actions.
> Building on this model, we treat storytelling as "_inverse_ inverse
> planning," the task of choosing actions to manipulate an inverse planner's
> inferences.
> 
> Our framework is grounded in literary theory, naturally capturing many
> storytelling elements from first principles. We give a series of examples to
> demonstrate this, with supporting evidence from human subject studies.
